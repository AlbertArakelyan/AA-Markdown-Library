# Docker Cheatsheet

### **Docker Cheat Sheet: Common Commands and Their Functions**

An easy-to-understand Docker cheat sheet covering the most commonly used Docker commands and terms. Each entry explains what it does in a straightforward way.

---

### 1. **docker build**

```bash
docker build -t your_image_name .
```

- **Purpose**: Creates an image from a `Dockerfile`.
- **Explanation**: This command builds a Docker image based on the instructions in a `Dockerfile`, usually located in the current directory (`.`). The `t` flag allows you to tag the image with a name.

---

### 2. **docker run**

```bash
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name webserver nginx
```

- **Purpose**: Runs a new container from an image.
- **Explanation**: Creates a new container from an image (e.g., `nginx`) and runs it. Options include `d` (detached mode, runs in the background), `p` (maps a port, e.g., `80:80`), and `-name` (gives the container a name, e.g., `webserver`).

---

### 3. **docker start**

```bash
docker start container_name
```

- **Purpose**: Starts an existing, stopped container.
- **Explanation**: If you have a container that was created and stopped, this command will start it again without creating a new one.

---

### 4. **docker stop**

```bash
docker stop container_name
```

- **Purpose**: Stops a running container.
- **Explanation**: This gracefully stops a container by shutting down the processes running inside it.

---

### 5. **docker ps**

```bash
docker ps
```

- **Purpose**: Lists running containers.
- **Explanation**: Shows all currently running containers and their details like container ID, name, image, status, ports, etc. Use `docker ps -a` to list all containers, including stopped ones.

---

### 6. **docker exec**

```bash
docker exec -it container_name bash
```

- **Purpose**: Executes a command inside a running container.
- **Explanation**: This command allows you to run commands inside a container. The `it` flag runs an interactive shell (like `bash`) inside the container.

---

### 7. **docker rm**

```bash
docker rm container_name
```

- **Purpose**: Removes a stopped container.
- **Explanation**: Deletes a container from your system. The container must be stopped first (or you can use `docker rm -f container_name` to forcefully remove a running container).

---

### 8. **docker rmi**

```bash
docker rmi image_name
```

- **Purpose**: Removes an image.
- **Explanation**: Deletes a Docker image from your local system. You may want to use `docker images` to list images first. Note: You cannot remove an image if containers based on it are still running.

---

### 9. **docker pull**

```bash
docker pull mysql
```

- **Purpose**: Downloads an image from Docker Hub (or another registry).
- **Explanation**: Retrieves the specified image (e.g., `mysql`) from Docker Hub and saves it locally so you can use it later.

---

### 10. **docker push**

```bash
docker push your_dockerhub_username/your_image_name
```

- **Purpose**: Uploads an image to a Docker registry.
- **Explanation**: Pushes an image from your local system to a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub) so others can download and use it.

---

### 11. **docker commit**

```bash
docker commit container_name new_image_name
```

- **Purpose**: Creates a new image from a container's changes.
- **Explanation**: If you've made changes to a container (like installing software), you can save those changes as a new image with this command.

---

### 12. **docker logs**

```bash
docker logs container_name
```

- **Purpose**: Shows the logs from a running or stopped container.
- **Explanation**: Displays the output (logs) generated by a container’s processes. This is useful for debugging or tracking what's happening inside the container.

---

### 13. **docker inspect**

```bash
docker inspect container_name
```

- **Purpose**: Shows detailed information about a container or image.
- **Explanation**: Provides detailed, low-level information (in JSON format) about a container, image, or other Docker object.

---

### 14. **docker network ls**

```bash
docker network ls
```

- **Purpose**: Lists all Docker networks.
- **Explanation**: Displays the available Docker networks on your system. Networks allow containers to communicate with each other.

---

### 15. **docker volume ls**

```bash
docker volume ls
```

- **Purpose**: Lists all Docker volumes.
- **Explanation**: Shows all volumes, which are used to store persistent data outside of a container's lifecycle.

---

### 16. **docker-compose up**

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

- **Purpose**: Starts services defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file.
- **Explanation**: Runs multiple containers as defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file. The `d` flag runs it in detached mode. Containers are automatically networked and can share resources.

---

### 17. **docker-compose down**

```bash
docker-compose down
```

- **Purpose**: Stops and removes all containers defined in a `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Explanation**: Shuts down the running containers and removes networks, volumes, and containers created by `docker-compose up`.

---

### 18. **docker image prune**

```bash
docker image prune
```

- **Purpose**: Removes unused Docker images.
- **Explanation**: Cleans up unused images (those not referenced by any containers) to free up disk space.

---

### 19. **docker system prune**

```bash
docker system prune
```

- **Purpose**: Cleans up unused resources (containers, networks, images, etc.).
- **Explanation**: This command removes all unused containers, networks, images, and optionally, volumes, freeing up space.

---

### 20. **docker tag**

```bash
docker tag source_image new_image_name
```

- **Purpose**: Creates a tag for an image.
- **Explanation**: Tags an image with a new name (and optionally a version). This is useful for versioning or preparing an image for a registry push.
